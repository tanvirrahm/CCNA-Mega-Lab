## üìñ Overview  
This repository showcases my work on the **CCNA Mega Lab**, a comprehensive project designed to test and implement key networking concepts. This lab mirrors real-world scenarios, emphasizing routing, switching, VLANs, and troubleshooting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objectives  
- Build and configure a complex Layer 2 and Layer 3 network topology.  
- Apply and validate **Cisco IOS** networking concepts.  
- Troubleshoot connectivity and optimize network performance.  

---

## üåü Features  
1. **VLAN Configuration**  
   - Created multiple VLANs for logical segmentation.  
   - Configured VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and inter-VLAN routing.  

2. **Routing Protocols**  
   - Implemented **OSPF** and **EIGRP** for efficient route propagation.  
   - Configured static and dynamic routing for specific use cases.  

3. **EtherChannel**  
   - Configured EtherChannel for increased bandwidth and redundancy.  

4. **Security Features**  
   - Implemented basic switch port security to prevent unauthorized access.  
   - Configured secure remote access using **SSH**.  

5. **Troubleshooting**  
   - Diagnosed and resolved network connectivity issues using tools like **ping**, **traceroute**, and **debug** commands.

## üñß Topology  
The project used the following devices and connections:  
- **Routers**: 2 (Cisco 2901)  
- **Switches**: 4 (Cisco 2960)  
- **End Devices**: PCs and servers  

*Diagram of the network topology is included in the `/diagrams` folder.*
